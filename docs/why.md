I was stressed. I had to study while maintaining the project, so one day, I decided I had to get rid of something, and between "studies" and "project", I really didn't have to think much to choose which one to get rid of. But I'm back, I suppose I won't be taking too seriously this project, to avoid future crisis.

Revived project because I was bored
