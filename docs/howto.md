<h1 align="center">How to use</h1>

<h2 align="center">1. Install Node.JS</h2>

To install Node.JS, you have to download the installer from its [homepage](https://nodejs.org/).

When you have downloaded the launcher, click it and let it install.

Once it's installed, you should be able to use Node.JS from the terminal.

<h2 align="center">2. Download the project</h2>

Head over to the [Releases tab](https://github.com/amoraschi/AFKBot/releases/latest) and download the first file from <em>Assets</em>.

Extract the downloaded <em>.zip</em> anywhere you like.

<h2 align="center">3. Configure the project</h2>

Head into the extracted folder and open the `config.json` file, JSON stands for `JavaScript Object Notation` and the program will error out if it doesn't follow a set of rules.

There are a lot of options, but a lot of them work if you leave them at their default value.

<h2 align="center">4. Start the program</h2>

Open the folder, and type `cmd` in the address bar, this will open a terminal already in the folder.

Now we have to install the dependencies, type `npm install` in the terminal. This should take a while, but it should install all dependencies. `npm install` only has to be typed once, in the next runs, you can just type `npm start` directly.

Now you just have to type `npm start` to start the program.
